This is a game I made in my second year for fun and to try to get to grips with java swing. It is a dice poker game. I got the idea from when I was playing
The Witcher 1 and 2 where in the game you could play Dice poker. When you press the button the program will roll 5 dice for you and the opponent and then look who wins
according to the rules of dice poker (as I know them).

To run cd to the src folder and then type make. After that type java GUI and the program should run
